# UNET-SkinCancer-Analysis
In this study, two different models, M1 and M2, are utilized for skin cancer segmentation, employing four distinct loss functions: Jaccard Distance, Binary Crossentropy, Dice Loss, and Focal Loss. The models follow a UNet-like architecture, featuring convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation functions, spatial dropout, max pooling, and upsampling. Each model undergoes training with 100 epochs using the specified loss functions. The evaluation metrics, including Intersection over Union (IOU), Dice Coefficient, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy, are computed for each combination of model and loss function. The objective is to analyze how the choice of model and loss function impacts the segmentation performance, as reflected by the variations in evaluation metrics. This investigation aims to provide insights into the efficacy of different model architectures and loss functions for skin cancer segmentation tasks.
